    "The `while` statement in Python is one of the most general ways to perform iteration. A while statement will repeat a single or group of statements (i.e. a block of code) as long as its condition is `true`. The reason it is called a 'loop' is that statements are repeated until their condition is no longer met.\n",

    "The general form of a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    while test:\n",
    "        code statement\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        final code statement\n",
    "        \n",
    "We can also use the `while` loop in Python to recreate the \"classic\" loop form we talked about in the previous chapter. Here is a brief recap of the loop form as used in C, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for(i = 1; i <= 10; i+)\n",
    "       printf(\"i: %d\\n\", i);\n",
    "        \n",
    "In Python, we need to define the count variable *i* in advance and then take it into the code block of the `while` loop to ensure functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i = 1\n",
    "    while i < 10:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "        i+=1\n",
    "        \n",
    "Looking at it a bit more theoretically, we can say there are a total of 3 types of loops in programming languages:\n",
    "1. counter-controlled loops - do not exist in Python, but can be emulated with an `while` loop, as shown in the example.\n",
    "2. condition-controlled loops - correspond to `while` loops in Python\n",
    "3. collection-controlled loops - correspond to `for` loops in Python.\n",
